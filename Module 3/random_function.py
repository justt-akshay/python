->Setting the same seed value for random number generation provides 
consistent and reproducible results every time you run your program. 
This is because the sequence of random numbers is determined by the seed value.
If you use the same seed, you will get the same sequence of random numbers.

->If we run our program multiple times with this seed,
we will always get the same sequence of random numbers.
This behavior is beneficial for tasks 
where we need consistency and want to reproduce the same random behavior,
such as debugging or testing.'''
