#What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java?
'''
->oops:paradigm for developing appn.(paradigm:methodology or stratergy to dev appn/style of programme)
->Encaspsulation,Abstraction,Inheritance,Polyorphism:these principals must be followed by any oop lang.

->Enc.:means combining all the related things together.
->Abs.:means showing required features and hiding internal details.
->Inhe.: inheriting the features of existing class.
->Poly.:one name and different actions .
    By using a single item we can refer multiple things together.
    
->Java supports single inheritance, which means a class can only inherit from one superclass.
    However, Java supports a form of multiple inheritance through interfaces. 
    An interface in Java is a collection of abstract methods (methods without a body) that a class can implement.
