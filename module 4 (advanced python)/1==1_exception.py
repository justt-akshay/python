#What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed?
'''
->In Python, when the expression "1" == 1 is executed, it will evaluate to False.
->This is because the equality operator (==) checks for both value and type equality.
->The left side, "1", is a string literal.
->The right side, 1, is an integer literal.
