#Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

'''
Exception Handling:
->Exception handling is a programming concept that deals with the occurrence of errors during the execution of a program. 
->In Python, an error is generally referred to as an exception.
->When an error occurs, Python raises an exception, which is an object representing an error state.
->The process of dealing with these exceptions in a systematic manner is known as exception handling. 
->It involves the use of try, except, and finally blocks. 

Error:
->An error in Python is a deviation from the intended behavior of a program, and it can lead to the generation of exceptions. 
->Errors can be of various types, such as syntax errors, runtime errors, or logical errors.
->Exception handling allows you to gracefully handle these situations and provide a mechanism for the program to recover or exit gracefully.
